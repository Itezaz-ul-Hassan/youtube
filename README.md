# Vid-Box Website

Vid-Box is a Youtube Clone project. it started as a project developed on a Platzi Live class. in which I learned new concepts. The site was not fully funtional or responsive and I wanted more. So I put some work and managed to add new features and make it what its now. A responsive site with a darkmode button, a hidden sidebar menu and a working Search Box that consume a youtube API.
